We implemented the chatbot using Python, focusing on if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to understand user queries and provide relevant responses effectively.


NLP Foundations: Leveraging Python's capabilities, we integrated basic NLP techniques to interpret and respond to natural language inputs.

If-Else Logic: Implemented robust if-else statements to handle a wide range of user queries, ensuring the chatbot could engage in meaningful conversations.

Pattern Matching: Utilized pattern matching libraries such as re to enhance response accuracy and expand functionality based on user-defined patterns.
